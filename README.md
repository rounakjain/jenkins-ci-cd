# End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, Helm & Kubernetes

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline where a Java Spring Boot application
is automatically built, containerized, pushed to Docker Hub, and deployed to a Kubernetes
cluster using Helm.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- Maven
- Docker
- Docker Hub
- Kubernetes (KinD)
- Helm

## 🔁 CI/CD Flow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins triggers pipeline
3. Maven builds the application
4. Docker image is created and pushed to Docker Hub
5. Helm deploys the application to Kubernetes (KinD)
